a repository to start with

Hi there! this is my first practice on the Github, hope it can work out well.

Besides, here is a note that needed to be recorded: 

"Chaos is not a pit. Chaos is a ladder. Many who try to climb it fail and never get to try again.The fail breaks them. And some are given a chance to climb, but they refuse. They cling to the realm or the gods or love. Illusions. Only the ladder is real. The climb is all there is."
